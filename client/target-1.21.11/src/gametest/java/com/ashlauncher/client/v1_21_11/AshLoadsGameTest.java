/**
 * A real vanilla client, launched, with ash in it.
 *
 * <p>Every other tier stops short of this one. The unit tests never start the
 * game; the manifest tests only read what the build wrote. This is the tier
 * that would catch a mixin which has stopped matching its target, and
 * ADR-0017's choice to let a feature degrade rather than crash is safe only
 * because it exists — a degradation nothing detects is indistinguishable from
 * a feature that was never there.
 *
 * <p>Its manifest names no dependency on `ash`, which looks like an omission
 * and is not. With `depends` on `ash`, the loader would refuse to start when
 * ash was missing and this assertion would never run - the loader would be
 * doing the catching and the test would be along for the ride. Without it, the
 * game starts either way and the line below is what decides, which is the only
 * arrangement in which it means anything.
 *
 * <p>What is drawn is asserted by eye rather than by pixel. The screenshot
 * taken in a world is the only automated picture of the HUD there is - the
 * title screen has none - and it is kept as a CI artifact so the readout and
 * the marker can be seen without anyone launching the game.
